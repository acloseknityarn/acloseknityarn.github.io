#### What is git ?
_Git tracks changes made in a computer file and stores it so that one can come back to any change done in the past and do something with it._ 

These are the basic git commands that I learnt: 

1. `git init`: _The git init command creates a new **Git repository** (a place where things are stored)._
 This command will transform the current directory into a Git repository and will add a .git subdirectory to the current directory which will make it possible to start recording **revisions/changes** of the project. 
 What you need to do is cd (command directory) into your project subdirectory and run **_git init,_** and you'll have a fully functional Git repository i.e now you can use git commands and track your changes in this git repository. Lastly git will not override an existing .git configuration.
